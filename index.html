	<h1>Adam Paton - Lab 1</h1>
  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Instructions: rewrite this page by adding a few sentences about yourself. Add a heading. Post it to your basecamp</p>
	<p>Hello, my name is Adam, as you can see by the heading. I've been working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript for quite some time now.</p>
	<p>My knowledge of it is decent but pretty speratic. I am looking forward to solidifying it with this course!</p>
